Remember, you should have spent a good amount of time in the last assignment learning how to install a text editor,
run the text editor, run a command prompt, and work with both of them.
If you haven't done that then don't go on, you'll not have a good time.
This is the only time I'll start an exercise with a warning that you should not skip or get ahead of yourself.
